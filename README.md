Please first set up the environment, launch the redis via Docker

``` 
docker run --name my-redis -p 6379:6379 --restart always --detach redis

Do not have much time to write the code for this, so only a simple demo for this, lots of things need to be improved, sorry about this.

For example, I used only redis for the convenience.
